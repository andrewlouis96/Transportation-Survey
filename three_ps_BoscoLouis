I accomplished everything that i wanted to accomplish this past week.John was able to guide me reagrding a couple things.
Simona and I spent a lot of time in work sessions marinating in the data. I have done the necessary descriptive analysis and was able to
come up with a couple research questions and have 90% of my analysis done. I am meeting with my client this friday to discuss
feedback on the first draft of my dashboard. I will also confirm presentation date & time and confirm a platform for the written product
during this meeting.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?

Nothing yet. But i fear setting up data pipelines for my client for the digital product might be one hell to go through.

Complete the remaining 90% of my analysis and have a first draft of the written product ready. After getting feedback on my digital
product this friday maybe work on a second draft of the dashboard.

I have finally received everything I need from the city. I've shared it with Simona and we have done some preliminary cleaning on the SPSS format
data. We are meeting this Friday for a work session on the analysis part. 
I've been working on a code chunk that would extract meaningful information out of certain text columns in the data. I've actually had to do
quite a bit of engineering on this part.

Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?

They have been out of the office this past week and just got back to my messages on Monday. I told them we need the data in SASS from Qualtrics.
They said that they actuallu used Parks and Recs account in Qualtrics to run their survey. So, she needs to reach out to them in order to get
what is needed. I suspect I will get the data next week. 

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?

Acquiring what's needed and communicating with my clients has been the hardest park so far. Hopefully, things get better from here.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?

Hopefully, have a skeleton built for the power bi model which will help in building the dashboard.
Brainstorm with Simona once we can get our hands on the data and explore the possibilities.

Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?

Brainstormed with my boss and decided on a couple ideas for the project.
One was a model to recognize merchant names and another to find recurring transations to infer subcription services.
We finally decided on scoring or evaluating different models to find the best credit risk scoring model that will best fit our needs.
We drafted our proposal and sent it to the Risk and Compliance team for approval.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?

The Complaince team rejected our proposal. My boss has worked with students from the university in Bozeman before so he was pretty confident there would be no issues.
However, it seems things have changed since then. We had already starting working on the merchant recognition model and had written code in python.
Pretty disappointed with the people I work for right now.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?

I've been scouting kaggle to see if I can find any interesting data there. no hope so far.
