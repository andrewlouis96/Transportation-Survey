Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?

After meeting with my client last friday, i understood their demand. They are looking for something like the seattle commute survey. I told them i will give it a shot. And so i learned how to
get geocodes even if the data was collected in a very bad format. I learned how to use census maps and geopandas in python to analyze survey data this way. It was fun! I then got my first draft
of the written product done.


Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?

Not exactly stuck on anything but struggling. I feel like I have done a lot here. 
I have had to do quite some data engineering (data cleaning/transformation/combination/wrangling) for any kind of analysis i wanted to do. The survey was not designed or implemented in an
analytical friendly way. I guess this will be a learning experience for them but it was a huge and terrible headache for me.

I had to summarise the meanings in custom entry columns in the survey and so I worked with John to figure out how to use the openai aip in python.
I have gotten deep into every survey question and now i have descriptive statistics on all of the questions and spent time with simona.
Initially, i didnt know what to do with the project so I had tried to build a model to see which questions were good at guessing if someone was interested in an app or not.
I did anova, logistic regression, random forests, xgboosts, and a chi-squared test to prove relation between two variables.

Now after they requested a copy of the seattle commute survey
but with montana survey data because that is what they had in mind when they did the survey, ive had to do a lot more work.

I am not even going to get into all the work behind making a dashboard in power bi. Thats just been another work. When i look forward there are presentations 
and stuff coming too and i have to manage work and have to travel for a week in april. Anyways, I am meeting with my client again this friday 
and i have shared my first draft they requested with them. They have been very nice so far but im afraid when i go back to meet them, i feel 
like they might ask me for more. hopefully they dont.

I feel like I have done more work for the city this month than i have for the bank that pays me $. That's concerning.

And before all of this, I thought i would be working on a project with my bank. So i had done a considerable amount of work on other projects that ive had to complete at work anyways.
So ive had to do that work but not been able to publish it. But i woudnt eben have started any of that if it wasnt for the capstone.

So, in a way, ive had to do a lot in this capstone class. I hope all of this will be worth it oneday. lol

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?

Have the dashboard ready to submit this sunday after geting feedback friday. Guess will have to write reviews for others' writtern products too.
Make changes on the repo design and upload more code chunks. This might change depending on what feedback i get from my client.

How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?

I spent about 20 hours.

03/17/2025

Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?

I met with my client last friday and got feedback for my digital product and my analysis. They said they would like to see more
information regarding a certain question from the survey. I am figuring out how to satisfy their asks and needs.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?

Nothing yet.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?

Have a second draft of the dashboard and get feedback again. Try to have the written product done.

How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?

03/10/2025

Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?

I accomplished everything that i wanted to accomplish this past week.John was able to guide me reagrding a couple things.
Simona and I spent a lot of time in work sessions marinating in the data. I have done the necessary descriptive analysis and was able to
come up with a couple research questions and have 90% of my analysis done. I am meeting with my client this friday to discuss
feedback on the first draft of my dashboard. I will also confirm presentation date & time and confirm a platform for the written product
during this meeting.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?

Nothing yet. But i fear setting up data pipelines for my client for the digital product might be one hell to go through.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?

Complete the remaining 90% of my analysis and have a first draft of the written product ready. After getting feedback on my digital
product this friday maybe work on a second draft of the dashboard.

How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?

I spent about 28 - 30 hours.

03/04/2025

Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?

I have finally received everything I need from the city. I've shared it with Simona and we have done some preliminary cleaning on the SPSS format
data. We are meeting this Friday for a work session on the analysis part. 
I've been working on a code chunk that would extract meaningful information out of certain text columns in the data. I've actually had to do
quite a bit of engineering on this part.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?

Nothing yet.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?

Have two code chunks ready to post on guthub. Get my github page ready and design it accordingly.
Have a first draft of the analysis ready.

Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?

I have a dashboard kinda ready. Will need to show to the city and get feedback. Heard from the city that the data i requested will
be here in the next 2 days. Eagerly waiting to get my hands on it so i can start to do some analysis. Looking into how I can use the
text data in certain columns.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?

Nothing yet.

02/19/2025

Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?

They have been out of the office this past week and just got back to my messages on Monday. I told them we need the data in SASS from Qualtrics.
They said that they actuallu used Parks and Recs account in Qualtrics to run their survey. So, she needs to reach out to them in order to get
what is needed. I suspect I will get the data next week. 

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?

Acquiring what's needed and communicating with my clients has been the hardest park so far. Hopefully, things get better from here.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?

Hopefully, have a skeleton built for the power bi model which will help in building the dashboard.
Brainstorm with Simona once we can get our hands on the data and explore the possibilities.

I spent about 3 hours.


02/12/2025

Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?

Met with the City people and Simona. I haven't achieved anything this week honestly. There has been a lot going on this past week
so I think I'm going to need time until this weekend to catch up on stuff and take off with the project. 

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?

Nothing yet.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?

I'm going to put together an initial plan on how i'm going to bring this project together and how/what deliverables would be best.

Did some initial exploratory analysis with the survey data. Brainstormed for a bit about what analysis I could do with the data.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?

Nothing yet. 

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?

I'm meeting with them on Friday at 10:30 am. I intend to ask them what their research question was when they designed the survey 
and what requirements they have for the dashboard.

How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?

I'd say about 2 hours in total since last class.


01/27/2025

Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?

Brainstormed with my boss and decided on a couple ideas for the project.
One was a model to recognize merchant names and another to find recurring transations to infer subcription services.
We finally decided on scoring or evaluating different models to find the best credit risk scoring model that will best fit our needs.
We drafted our proposal and sent it to the Risk and Compliance team for approval.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?

The Complaince team rejected our proposal. My boss has worked with students from the university in Bozeman before so he was pretty confident there would be no issues.
However, it seems things have changed since then. We had already starting working on the merchant recognition model and had written code in python.
Pretty disappointed with the people I work for right now.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?

I've been scouting kaggle to see if I can find any interesting data there. no hope so far.

How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?

I'd say about 10 hours in total since last class.
